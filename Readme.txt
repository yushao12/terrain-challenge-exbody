This Readme file accompanies the FBX conversion (2019) of the 
Motionbuilder-friendly BVH conversion (2010) of the Carnegie-Mellon
University (CMU) Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database.  

The Motionbuilder-friendly BVH conversion was released by Bruce
Hahne first in 2008 and then again in 2010. The BVH files are available
at www.cgspeed.com. The original ASF/AMC dataset can be found
at http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/.

The reason for this conversion is to make the dataset available for a 
wider variety of software packages. Most animation packages and game engines
have no factory BVH support. I have also taken the oportunity to fix
the height in the T-Poses and the framerates of many files.
